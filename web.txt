How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link?

The internet is how multiple computers work together and communicate to transfer
and share data. They have files or packets on their server and when requested 
will transfer those files to other computers. Those will then be displayed in the 
form of webpages or other applications.

When you click on a link it has an IP address that sends the request to the server. 
Then the server pulls the data and then sends it in small packets back to the client
and comes out as a webpage. Any of these requests will go through a router to help 
the requests get to the right location.
